# Artificial Neural Networks
This repository consists of some of the works and the obseravtions that were shared through the different JUPYTER notebooks about topics related to ANNs. The details for each one is listed below:

* 1. **Working with Optimizers and Neural Networks:** This file compares different kinds of Optimizers and Grid Search is done on Learning rate. Proper analysis is done with the differet non convex functions and a Resnet 50 model was used after retaining  the pretrained weights from the imagenet dataset and generating the last layer according to the VadaPav and Burger dataset that is fetched from Kaggle. Grid Search in that is used in order to check the optimal learning rate for the present model. 
* 2. **Prediction and analysis of thermal errors for efficient CNC machining:** This project is detailed in [this PPT](https://github.com/ASHU-web/artificial_neural_networks/blob/main/CNC%20MACHINING%20PPT.pdf). Please visit [this link](https://github.com/ASHU-web/artificial_neural_networks/blob/main/CNC%20MACHINING%20PPT.pdf) for the details.
